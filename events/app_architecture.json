      "description": "Todayâ€™s api driven, realtime applications require a different architecture and a set of new tools to support the architecture. \n\nNode.js is at the center of such tools and along with supporting software, enables us to support millions of realtime connections with inexpensive hardware. \n\nIn this presentation I will take you through a journey that shows you how you can create highly scalable applications using a simplified but distributed application architecture.\n\n I will also show you why companies like eBay, PayPal, Yahoo and Walmart have adopted node.js and the efficiencies they have been able to gain.",
