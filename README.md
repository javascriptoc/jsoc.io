## Proposing an Event

This is an attempt to make event proposals self service and transparent. Feedback is welcome and appreciated!

Each of our events is defined in its own json file in the `events/` directory. A new talk just means a new json file. You won't need to build or test anything in this repo to submit your talk, just create a new json file per the instructions below:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo
2. Use example-event.json and fill in the details for your event. For things you don't know (i.e. location/date) don't worry, we'll add that later.
3. Save this new json file as `events/<whatever_name_you_want>.json`.
4. Submit a [PR](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) back to this repo.

Please feel free to ask any questions or add additional info via the [PR comments](https://help.github.com/articles/commenting-on-the-diff-of-a-pull-request/).
